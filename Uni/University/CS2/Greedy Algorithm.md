Greedy Algorithm
	- Optimization Problems:
		> an optimization problem is one in which you want to find, not just a solution, but the best solution
			=> e.g. going somewhere with min cost, completing a series to maximize profits, etc.
		> a "greedy algorithm" sometimes works well for optimization problems
		> a greedy algorithm works in phases
			=> at each phase you take the best you can get right now, without regard for future consequences
			=> you hope that by choosing a 'local' optimum at each step, you will end up at a 'global' optimum
	- Intuition of Greedy:
		> say you want to hire someone for a role in a company
		> you want to hire the best candidate
		> you have the following selection process:
			=> CV screening, written test, HR screening, Technical test, on site test interview
			=> You
		> you had advertised the job and 1000 people applied
			=> going through all above steps for all 1000 people will be very time consuming
		> you will eliminate and shorten list candidates at each step and in this way at the end you will get the best candidate
		> in greedy approach, we choose the best at each step with a hope that we will find the best at the end
	- Examples of Greedy Problems:
		> most networking algorithms use greedy approach
		> travelling salesman problem
		> Prim's minimal spanning tree algorithm
		> Kruskal's minimal spanning tree algorithm
		> Dijkstra's minimal spanning tree algorithm
		> Graph - Map coloring
		> Graph - Vertex cover
		> Knapsack problem
		> Job scheduling problem
